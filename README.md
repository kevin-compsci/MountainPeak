# MountainPeak

A coding challenge called MountainPeak that will take an array of integers, and output the ith index which is the highest "peak." The peak is determined where A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1]. Original design and challenge belong to their creative authors and affiliates. This challenge was completed by Kevin in 2018.

NOTE: This challenge does not take into account for multiple peaks.
